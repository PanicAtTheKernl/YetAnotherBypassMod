# YetAnotherBypassMod (YABM) 🌟

## Discover Every Minecraft Server – Your Way! 🐾

Minecraft can be a bit picky about which servers you can visit. **YABM** makes server exploration **fun, safe, and totally under your control**. Offline, custom, educational, or just quirky – if you want to check it out, you can!

**Perfect for:**

* Curious tinkerers who love custom servers 🛠️
* Players frustrated by confusing “blocked” messages 😸
* Anyone who wants **full control and fun** in multiplayer 🎮

> No hacks. No tricks. Just pure, joyful server exploring! ✨

YABM isn’t officially endorsed by Mojang or Microsoft. That’s okay! Just remember to respect the [`Minecraft EULA`](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) and have a good time exploring. Be kind, curious, and adventurous!
