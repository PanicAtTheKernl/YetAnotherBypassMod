# YetAnotherBypassMod (YABM)

## The Mod That Just Says “Fuck Your Blocklist, Mojang”

Minecraft loves to block servers because apparently **you’re too dumb to choose your own damn server**.
**YABM** exists so you can finally \*\*see every server you want, \*\*offline, custom, educational, or just plain weird.

This mod is for:

* Nerds who tinker with custom servers
* Players sick of Mojang’s arbitrary “blocked” nonsense
* Anyone who enjoys **actually controlling their multiplayer experience**

> No authentication hacks. No server spoofing. Just freedom.

## How to Be a Rebel (Legal Stuff)

⚠️ YABM is **not endorsed by Mojang or Microsoft**, and frankly, we don’t give a shit if they don’t like it.

Use responsibly. Follow the [`Minecraft EULA`](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) if you’re scared of lawyers, and don’t cry when someone calls you a rebel.
