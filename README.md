# Custom Server Access Mod

## A Fabric Mod for Customizing Server Filter Behavior

Minecraft includes a system to filter servers from the multiplayer list based on server-side moderation reports or internal policy decisions.
This mod gives technical users the ability to override this behavior on the client side.

The goal of this mod is to support:
* Offline, archival, or educational use cases
* Players using custom server software
* Client-side experimentation and mod interoperability

This mod does not modify or interfere with authentication, and it does not spoof server status.
It simply disables the automatic filter that blocks certain servers from being shown in the multiplayer list.
